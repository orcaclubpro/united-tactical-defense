hero: 
rework our hero section to be really eye catching and hook the user. I want to use ty.mov to run in the background of this section to set the aesthetic. I want logo.png to be on the right side of the text. Implement the new text to sythesize well with this new layout and change 5000 to 3000+. Change the claim free class button to book free class button which should bring up the pop up when pressed. This section should be clean and modern while serving to catch the users attention.
