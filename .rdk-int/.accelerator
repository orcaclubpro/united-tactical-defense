# Phase Acceleration Strategies

## Current Phase: 1/3 (Core API Integration)
Acceleration target: Complete by Week 1 end

## Acceleration Decisions
- DEFER: Advanced error handling to Phase 2
- SIMPLIFY: Use basic authentication flow initially, enhance security in later iterations
- REUSE: Leverage existing HTTP client libraries for API communication
- PARALLELIZE: FormAPIClient and AuthService can be developed simultaneously

## Minimum Viable Deliverables
- FormAPIClient: Basic form submission and retrieval functionality
- AuthService: Essential token-based authentication with manual refresh
- CalendarAPIClient: Simple appointment booking capability

## Technical Debt Log
- Comprehensive error handling: To be addressed in Phase 2
- Advanced retry mechanisms: To be addressed in Phase 2
- Robust token refresh: To be enhanced in Phase 2
- Comprehensive validation: To be enhanced in Phase 2

## Validation Criteria
The phase is considered complete when:
- FormAPIClient can successfully submit forms to the backend
- AuthService can authenticate users and provide valid tokens
- CalendarAPIClient can fetch availability and book basic appointments
- Basic error handling is implemented for common failure scenarios
- Unit tests verify the core functionality of each service
