# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### HIGH PRIORITY
- PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION (Next: Implement FormAPIClient with basic API connectivity)
- NEXT GOAL: Complete FormAPIClient for core form operations and AuthService for secure authentication

### Completed
- Initial project setup
- Architecture design and documentation
- Directory structure creation
- Interface definitions for core services

### Next Steps
1. Implement FormAPIClient
   - Files: /src/services/api/FormAPIClient.ts
   - Integration: Connect with backend API endpoints
   - Features: Form retrieval, submission, validation

2. Create AuthService
   - Files: /src/services/auth/AuthService.ts, /src/services/auth/TokenManager.ts
   - Integration: Handle authentication with backend
   - Features: Login, token refresh, session management

3. Update CalendarAPIClient
   - Files: /src/services/api/CalendarAPIClient.ts
   - Integration: Connect with appointment scheduling API
   - Features: Availability checking, booking appointments

4. Implement error handling utilities
   - Files: /src/utils/ErrorHandling.ts
   - Integration: Used by all API clients
   - Features: Standardized error handling, retry logic

### Unsolved Problems
1. Rate limiting strategy for API calls
   - Impact: Medium
   - Blocking: No
   - Approach: Implement exponential backoff initially, refine based on API behavior

2. Token refresh mechanism
   - Impact: High
   - Blocking: Yes for authenticated requests
   - Approach: Research best practices for refresh token handling

3. Handling network unreliability
   - Impact: Medium
   - Blocking: No, but affects user experience
   - Approach: Implement basic retry logic initially, enhance in Phase 2
