Continue developing the Form Integration System using the current development state and continue implementation according to the framework guidelines below.

## System Context
- Current phase: 1/3 (Core API Integration)
- Phase focus: Implementing FormAPIClient and authentication services
- Development approach: Modular, testable, maintainable, and efficient

## Project Files
The following files define the project and its current state:
- .devflow: Development phases and tasks with deliverables
- .architecture: Current system design and component integration
- .changelog: Work completed, priority tasks, and unsolved problems

## Development Instructions
1. **Identify Current Status**: Based on the changelog, we're in Phase 1 (Core API Integration), implementing the FormAPIClient to connect with backend APIs with a focus on authentication and basic form submission.
   
2. **HIGH PRIORITY Implementation**: Focus on implementing Phase 1, specifically:
   - Implement FormAPIClient with connection to backend APIs
   - Create AuthService for secure authentication
   - Set up basic error handling and retry logic
   
3. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Develop modular components with clear separation of concerns
   - Follow interface-based design for extensibility
   - Ensure code adheres to the API design, performance, and maintainability requirements
   - Implement with testability, observability, and good developer experience in mind

4. **Update Documentation**:
   - Update the HIGH PRIORITY section with the next immediate task
   - List completed work with brief descriptions
   - Prioritize next steps with integration context
   - Document unsolved problems, prioritizing any blocking issues

5. **Architecture Updates**:
   - Update the .architecture file to reflect any structural changes
   - Ensure component interactions are properly documented

6. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Test the implementation against Phase 1 deliverable requirements
   - Verify integration with existing components

7. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Identify and implement architectural improvements

## Current Focus Area
- Working directory: /src/services
- Key files: FormAPIClient.ts, AuthService.ts
- Integration points: Backend API, Authentication service
- Specific challenges: Handling token-based authentication and API error scenarios

Respond with:
1. A brief analysis of the current development state
2. Implementation for FormAPIClient and AuthService
3. Updated changelog entries
4. Any architecture updates
5. Test verification approach
6. Suggestions for improvement
