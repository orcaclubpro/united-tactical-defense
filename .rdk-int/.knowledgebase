# Knowledge Base

## Authentication Approach
- JWT-based token authentication selected for stateless scaling
- Refresh token strategy using HttpOnly cookies with CSRF protection
- Token storage: Secure storage with in-memory access for active use
- Decision rationale: Balance of security and user experience for web applications

## API Communication Pattern
- RESTful API design with consistent endpoint structure
- Error handling: Standardized error response format with error codes
- Retry strategy: Exponential backoff with configurable limits
- Offline handling: Queue-based with conflict resolution
- Decision rationale: Reliable communication with graceful degradation

## Form Submission Design
- Two-phase submission: Validation then submission
- Client-side validation with server validation backup
- Progress tracking for multi-step forms
- Autosave capabilities for form progress
- Decision rationale: Improved user experience with data integrity protection

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Individual service and utility testing
- Integration tests: Service interaction verification
- End-to-end tests: Complete flow validation
- Mock strategy: API mocking for predictable testing
- Decision rationale: Comprehensive testing with fast feedback loops

## User Experience Considerations
- Loading states for all network operations
- Clear error messages with recovery options
- Offline indicators with sync status
- Form progress indicators
- Decision rationale: Transparent system status for improved user confidence
