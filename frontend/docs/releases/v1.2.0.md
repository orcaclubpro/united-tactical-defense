# Release v1.2.0: Form Submission Endpoint Update

## Overview

This release enhances the form submission system by adding direct integration with the GoHighLevel forms/submit endpoint. Form submissions can now be directed to `https://backend.leadconnectorhq.com/forms/submit` while maintaining consistent formatting and error handling.

## Key Changes

- Added new `FORM_SUBMISSION_ENDPOINT` in `api-config.ts`
- Extended `GoHighLevelAppointmentClient` with a `submitForm` method for direct form submissions
- Created new `submitHighLevelForm` export in the API layer for easy access
- Updated the `submitFreeClassForm` function to use the new endpoint
- Added complete documentation for the new features

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Configuration Update

Added the form submission endpoint to the GoHighLevel configuration:

```typescript
export const GO_HIGH_LEVEL_CONFIG = {
  APPOINTMENT_ENDPOINT: `${GO_HIGH_LEVEL_API_URL}/appengine/appointment`,
  FORM_SUBMISSION_ENDPOINT: `${GO_HIGH_LEVEL_API_URL}/forms/submit`,
  FORM_ID: 'bHbGRJjmTWG67GNRFqQY',
  LOCATION_ID: 'wCjIiRV3L99XP2J5wYdA',
  CALENDAR_ID: 'EwO4iAyVRl5dqwH9pi1O',
  DEFAULT_TIMEZONE: 'America/Los_Angeles'
};
```

### 2. New API Methods

Added a new method to the `GoHighLevelAppointmentClient`:

```typescript
async submitForm(formData: any): Promise<AppointmentResponse> {
  // Implementation details similar to submitAppointmentRequest
  // but using the forms/submit endpoint
}
```

### 3. API Layer Integration

Added a new export in `api/index.ts`:

```typescript
export const submitHighLevelForm = goHighLevelAppointmentClient.submitForm.bind(goHighLevelAppointmentClient);
```

### 4. Updated Free Class Form Submission 

Updated the `submitFreeClassForm` function to use the new endpoint:

```typescript
export const submitFreeClassForm = async (formData: any) => {
  try {
    console.log('Using GoHighLevel form submission for free class form');
    
    // Use the GoHighLevel form submission endpoint
    const response = await submitHighLevelForm(formData);
    
    // Return in a format consistent with axios responses
    return {
      data: response,
      status: 200,
      statusText: 'OK'
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in form submission:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## Usage

To submit a form directly to the GoHighLevel forms/submit endpoint:

```typescript
import { submitHighLevelForm } from './api';

// Submit form data
const result = await submitHighLevelForm({
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com',
  phone: '1234567890',
  experience: 'Beginner'
});
```

## Documentation

- Updated `APPOINTMENT_SYSTEM.md` with details on the new form submission capabilities
- Added a new section in `ARCHITECTURE.md` for direct form submissions
- Updated the main README with information about the enhanced form processing system

## Backward Compatibility

This change maintains full backward compatibility with existing form submissions. The original appointment submission endpoints and methods remain unchanged.
