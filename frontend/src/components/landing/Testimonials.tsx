The instructor\'s have all been great and they are educated and very competent. Chris has taught us how to safely and correctly handle a gun. Lamar, has taught us great self defense techniques for women. You always learn something new when you go to a class. We only joined six weeks ago and it has been one of the best things we have done for ourselves.',

Their expertise, professionalism and patience make learning new information about firearms, tactical training, scenarios, hands on and self defense not only helpful, but fun. Learn about firearm laws and safety protocol with other people of similar interests. My friend and I take the classes together, which makes it more fun. We find there are a lot of classes available. The new workshops and other additional classes that have been added, really add to the value of the monthly fee.',

The place has such a cool vibe and atmosphere. I have learned so much since starting there, and it\'s been an awesome experience. UDT should be a required prerequisite for CCW. I cannot recommend this place enough. 10 stars!',

UDT Anaheim has been a blessing. My first day (trial) I cried. No joke! But I signed up. I\'ve been attending since Dec 2024 and 2-3 times a week. In 2 short months, I\'ve been able to build my confidence, learned life saving skills, and excited about attending my classes. All the instructors are patient, compassionate, knowledgeable and most importantly supportive. No matter your reason for considering UDT, definitely attend the free trial. I think you\'ll see why I joined and many others have too. :)',
