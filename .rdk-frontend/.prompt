Continue developing United Tactical Defense Frontend Integration using the current development state and continue implementation according to the framework guidelines below.

## System Context
- Current phase: 1/4 (Core Form Integration)
- Phase focus: ModalFormContainer with multi-step support
- Development approach: Modular, testable, maintainable, and responsive
- Project structure: `/frontend/` contains all frontend code, `/src/` is strictly for backend code

## Project Files
The following files define the project and its current state:
- .devflow: Development phases and tasks with deliverables
- .architecture: Current system design and component integration
- .changelog: Work completed, high priority tasks, and unsolved problems

## Development Instructions
1. **Identify Current Status**: Based on the changelog, we're in Phase 1 (Core Form Integration), implementing the ModalFormContainer with a focus on multi-step form support and state management.
   
2. **HIGH PRIORITY Implementation**: Focus on implementing Phase 1, specifically:
   - Create the ModalFormContainer component with step management
   - Implement form context for state persistence across steps
   - Develop step navigation with progress indicators
   
3. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Develop modular components with clear separation of concerns
   - Follow interface-based design for extensibility
   - Ensure code adheres to responsive design requirements
   - Implement with testability and maintainability in mind

4. **Update Documentation and context**:
   - Update the HIGH PRIORITY section with the next immediate task
   - List completed work with brief descriptions
   - Prioritize next steps with integration context
   - Document unsolved problems, prioritizing any blocking issues

5. **Architecture Updates**:
   - Update the .architecture file to reflect any structural changes
   - Ensure component interactions are properly documented

6. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Test the implementation against Phase 1 deliverable requirements
   - Verify responsive design on multiple device sizes

7. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Identify and implement architectural improvements
