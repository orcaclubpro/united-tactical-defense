Continue developing the United Tactical Defense project using the current development state and continue implementation according to the framework guidelines below.

## System Context
- Current phase: 1/4 (Architecture & Foundation)
- Phase focus: Establishing architectural foundation and core infrastructure
- Development approach: Clean architecture, modular, testable, maintainable, and efficient

## Project Files
The following files define the project and its current state:
- .project: Project definition, objectives, and development principles
- .devflow: Development phases and tasks with deliverables
- .architecture: Current system design and component integration
- .changelog: Work completed, priority tasks, and unsolved problems

## Development Instructions
1. **Identify Current Status**: Based on the changelog, we're in Phase 1 (Architecture & Foundation), implementing the clean architecture pattern with a focus on establishing proper layer separation.
   
2. **HIGH PRIORITY Implementation**: Focus on completing the deliverables for a Phase , specifically:
    
3. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Develop modular components with clear separation of concerns
   - Follow interface-based design for extensibility
   - Ensure code adheres to the API design, performance, and maintainability requirements
   - Implement with testability, observability, and good developer experience in mind

4. **Update Documentation**:
   - Update the HIGH PRIORITY section with the next immediate task this needs to be a big item to make sure the project moves along nicely
   - List completed work with brief descriptions
   - Prioritize next steps with integration context
   - Document unsolved problems, prioritizing any blocking issues

5. **Architecture Updates**:
   - Update the .architecture file to reflect any structural changes
   - also update readme to amend changed to full architecture of app
   - Ensure component interactions are properly documented

6. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Test the implementation against Phase 1 deliverable requirements
   - Verify integration with existing components

7. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Identify and implement architectural improvements

## Current Focus Area
- Working directory: frontend/
- Key files: API controllers, service interfaces, data repositories
- Integration points: Layer interfaces, middleware pipeline, configuration system
- Specific challenges: Ensuring proper separation of concerns while maintaining efficient data flow
