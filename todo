#DEPLOYMENT PLAN FOR WENDESDAY

I want to change some of the layout in my landing page in the frontend folder
1. After the "From novice to Navy Seal" section add in a section below that is the ooda section . This sectino should show people "How to throw off the threats OODA Loop" using that diagram to show 7 steps. I want a horizantal diagram with pressable buttons regarding: Assessment, Draw, move, communicate, de-escalate, if they reach shoot
2. In training program workshops add these classes: Tactical Medicine, USCCA Legal Seminars, Vehicle CQB, Womans Urban threats, Home Defense, Firearm Familiarization.
3. Link the social media correctly at the bottom. UDT_anaheimhills
4. Change the question and answers for question 3 of the assesmnet
5. Add arrows for the Training Program to show that they can swipe to see programs. Also show at the top how many slides there are. Just like the Testimonial section. 
6. rework the design and layout of the instructor section so it's a clean and unique carousel design 
7. I want you to remove the shadows from the text as it makes it hard to read
8. Rework the 3rd question in our assesment form


I want to optimize the mobile layout of the landing page
1.eliminate that white gap in training program below "what you'll learn"
2. style the video section so that it catches the eye more
3. the top bar shouldn't disappear when we scroll down on IOS
